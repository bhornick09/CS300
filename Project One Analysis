// Big O Evaluation 

Vector: 
loadFile 
Open file = 0(1) 
While loop worst case is finishing entire loop 0(n) 
Split lines 0(1) 
CreateCourseObject 0(1)(the time createCourseObject takes) 

Total: 0(n) in worst case  


Hash Table: 
loadFile 
Open file = 0(1) 
While loop worst case is finishing entire loop 0(n) 
Split lines 0(1) 
Check for prerequesites 0(n) in worst case (hash collisions) 
CreateCourseObject 0(1)(the time createCourseObject takes) 

Total: 0(n^2) in worst case if while loop finishes and hash collisions exist 


Binary Search Tree: 
loadFile 
Open file = 0(1) 
While loop worst case is finishing entire loop 0(n) 
Split lines 0(1) 
Check for prerequesites 0(n) in worst case (unbalanced tree) 
CreateCourseObject 0(1)(the time createCourseObject takes) 

Total: 0(n^2) in worst case if while loop finishes and tree is unbalanced.
